Developed a machine learning classification model to improve sales effectiveness by predicting lead potential for a client organization. Performed data cleaning, 
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to identify key patterns in sales and lead data. Evaluated multiple supervised learning algorithms, 
optimized model performance, and generated insights to support data-driven decision making and enhance lead quality assessment deployed using flask.
